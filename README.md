# Flight Delay Analysis - Tableau Data Visualization Project  

## Project Overview  
This project is part of the Tableau Data Visualization Course, where I analyzed *flight delay data* from three distinct sources to gain insights into patterns, causes, and trends related to flight delays. The project involved cleaning, combining, and visualizing the dataset using Tableau.

## Dataset Description  
The datasets used for this project includes:  
- Barchart_data
- Linechart_data
- Map_data  

These fields enabled the creation of meaningful and informative visualizations to explore spatial and temporal patterns in flight delays.

## Objectives  
- Identify key factors contributing to flight delays.  
- Compare delays across different airlines and airports.  
- Visualize spatial distribution of delays using maps.  
- Analyze seasonal and monthly trends in flight delays.  

## Tools Used  
- *Tableau* for data visualization  
- *Excel/Google Sheets* for basic data cleaning  
- *GitHub* for version control and project documentation  

## Visualizations Created  
- Line charts showing *monthly delay trends*.  
- Bar charts comparing delays across *airlines and airports*.  
- Geographic maps highlighting *delay hotspots*.  
- Treemaps and heatmaps to show *delay types and their frequency*.

## Data Output:
Saved the Tableau visualizations to my Tableau Public account and also exported the visualizations in .pptx format which are uploaded in this repository.

## Insights  
- Certain airlines exhibited consistently higher delays.  
- Weather-related delays were more prevalent during specific months.  
- Major hub airports experienced significantly longer delays compared to regional airports.

## Course Information  
This project was completed as part of the *Data Visualization with Tableau* course on Coursera.
